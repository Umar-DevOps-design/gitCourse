Question: 

2.I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?


Answer:

Option-1 (Telnet Command)

telnet guvi.com 9000

We can use telnet guvi.com 9000 (If the port is open we get the connected message. If the port is not open we get the message "connection timeout" "
Unable to connect"

Option-2 Netcat (nc)

nc -zv guvi.com 9000


We can use the following online tool.

a) YouGetSignal Port Checker
b) Ping.eu Open Port Checker

Testing Locally on the Server:

http://localhost:9000
http://104.26.4.88:9000
http://104.26.5.88:9000

Additionally we can check server Firewall and Security Groups:

Conclusion: I've checked the telnet and Netcat command for guvi.com 9000 also checked the YouGetSignal Port Checker, Ping.eu Open Port Checker, the port 9000 is not open.
